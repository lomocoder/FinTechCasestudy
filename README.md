## Overview and Origin
## **Shakepay**


Allows residents of Canada to buy and sell cryptocurrencies through an application predominantly and isolated to Bitcoin and Ethereum at the moment.
Shakepay was incorporated in 2015 in Montreal, Canada.<sup>[1]
### Founders of the company: 
  The company was founded by Jean Amiouny and Roy Breidi.<sup>[1]
  
### Project Origin:

Shakepay’s original business plan was to provide clients with a card that they could load with Bitcoin and ultimately go into retail stores and make purchases. But they ran into issues with their partnering bank and VISA, this fallout led to the founders making Shakepay and Exchange<sup>[2]. 


### Funding : 
* February 2018: Shakepay raised 1M CAD in the round <sup>[3]
  
* January 2020: Shakepay received 44million CAD in series A funding<sup>[4]. 



## Business Activities

### Shakepay’s Purpose

The founders of shakepay set out to ease the difficulty of accessing cryptocurrencies in Canada. Over the years Canadians have found it near impossible to find a company/platform they can trust to aid in the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies. In 2019, Quadriga Fintech Solutions, which was a large scale cryptocurrency exchange filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations. This conundrum led to detrimental losses for retail investors and a total of $215million went missing and has not been recovered.<sup>[5]

### Target Clients

Shakepay is a Canadian company that tends to Canadians. The application is user friendly and enables Canadians of all ages, from university students to full time workers to the retired, use Shakepay to bridge to the digital economy, which is accessible via the internet. Shakepay has over 800,000 Canadians using the platform which equates to about 2% of the country and back in May 2021, Shakepay hosted 600,000 Canadians on the platform. The company has proven to be effective in this domain , which can be objectively seen by the growth of new customers onboarding and using the platform.<sup>[6]

### Competitive Advantage

In this fintech domain , there are other companies doing similar things to what shakepay is doing. Other companies give users the ability to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies on their platform. Converting cryptocurrencies to CAD is also a common theme amongst top companies in this domain but what makes Shakepay stand out is that they have a special reward program that enables users to earn SATS. SATS are the smallest unit of Bitcoin with a value of 0.00000001BTC.  The word SATS is derived from the name Satoshi Nakamoto who is the founder of Bitcoin. Thus, not only does Shakepay allow users to buy and sell crypto , it allows users to earn SATS. Users can earn SATS by opening the application and shaking their device and this will earn uses 100 satoshis #ShakingSats. Everyday that a user can shake their device they can earn satoshis and users that do this consecutively will have a streak. The amount of satoshis earned increases daily and users can earn up 1000satoshis by the 200th day of consecutive shaking<sup>[7] [8]. 

Shakepay users are entitled to a Shakepay prepaid visa card and this card gives users card rewards in satoshis. Users earn satoshi cashback rewards on all purchases made with the visa card. The rewards include a 2% cashback for up to a maximum of $5,000 of purchases and after which rewards would decline to 1%. Users can see their rewards in their Bitcoin balance of their Shakepay account<sup>[9]. 



## Landscape:

### Financial Industry Domain

Shakepay is in the blockchain and cryptocurrency domain. 
### Major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years
* **Bitcoin**- In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto introduced the concept of Bitcoin via a white paper. A white paper is a document that explains the concept behind a new technology, it includes the problem it wants to solve and the solution. Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency and it is a “A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution”. The problem? The sole reliance on Financial institutions to be third parties to process online payments. The solution ? Bitcoin and its trustless system.<sup>[9] [10]
* **Ethereum**- Vitalik Buterin ,a computer programmer and the founder of Ethereum introduced the concept to the world in 2013. Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum can be used to send and receive value globally, with its native currency ether but that is just one of the elements of ethereum. Ethereum functions to allow developers to create other cryptocurrencies or NFTS on its blockchain to solve real world problems therefore providing a use case.
   Cryptocurrencies or applications are built on Ethereum’s blockchain by use of smart contracts. Applications that are built on the blockchain are called decentralized applications or dapps. But what are smart contracts ? They are programs which are backed by code and they self sufficiently and automatically execute desired functions when the planned conditions are met.
  Ethereum officially launched its native token, ether, through an initial coin offering (ICO) in 2015. About 50 million of ether were sold at a price of $0.31 per coin, raising over $16 million for the project and this attracted more developers who wanted to create applications on the blockchain
* **NFTs**- Nonfungible tokens or NFTs are a form of digital art and can be used to represent ownership of unique items. A couple different things can be tokenized like an in-game item , a domain name, a limited edition sneaker and there can be only one official owner at a time. An individual can obtain a NFT via minting through smart contracts that allocate ownership and transferability of the non fungible token<sup> [11] [12].
* **Decentralized Finance(DEFI)**- The main reason why Satoshi invented Bitcoin was to eliminate financial institutions and initiate a trustless system. Decentralized finance is a prodigy of Bitcoin, It allows people, businesses and merchants to participate in the financial world via the ethereum blockchain and the use of smart contracts. Defi gives the world the opportunity to borrow , earn interest, lend, buy insurance, trade assets and even derivatives. The transactions are quicker, there is no middleman and no paperwork required like with traditional banks.<sup>[13] [14]

## Competitors
There are other companies in this domain ,which includes **Bitbuy**, **CoinSmart**, and **Newton**. These major companies all offer something special and special to the cryptocurrency community . 
## Results
### Core Metrics

In the blockchain and cryptocurrencies domain , companies use several features and factors to attract users to their platforms or exchanges. Does this mean that the metrics for success is the number of users an exchange has ?. Before choosing an exchange, a prospective user will consider a number of factors, which include: Authenticity and security , method of purchasing crypto , the number of supported coins and tokens, fee structure, customer support, user interface and withdrawal fees. Thus , prospective users tend to do substantial leg work before choosing to invest their cash in an exchange. 
Company|Users|Authencity|Number of Supported coins |Fee structure|Withdrawal|
---|---|---|---|---|---|
SHakepay|800,000+|Registered with FINTRAC|2|No commission 1-3% fee on spread|Free|

## Recommendations

Shakepay already holds two of the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, Ethereum and Bitcoin. However , they could benefit from adding USDT to their platform and not just USDT but other cryptocurrencies like Binancecoin , StellarLumen, Polkadot, Atom etc. USDT is a stablecoin , which means it is pegged to the US dollar, 1 USDT = 1 USD. 

### **Advantages of adding more assests**

* The addition of more assests would more users to the platform. More users will increase trading volume on the platform and therefore increase company profit and exposure.
* This will enable users to actively keep USDT on the platform. Most users do not want to hold ETH or BTC because of how volatile they can be.
* Users can send USDT to friends and family without fear of the price changing before it arrives at the destination address. 
### Technology
Shakepay currently sells digital assets to clients and clients buy assets directly from shakepay. Shakepay can add additional assets to their platform by incorporating a Peer to peer network(P2P). P2P will allow users to buy and sell assets from eachother and not from the exchange, thus the exchange would not have to hold the assets, the client will. P2P will lower Shakepay’s current fee structure because P2P are generally lower than standard trading fees.
